<h2>FOREWORD</h2>
<p>It is obviously impossible in the brief space of the
present booklet to offer more than the sketchiest outline
of Robert Schumann&rsquo;s short life but amazingly rich
achievement. Together with Haydn and Schubert he was,
perhaps, the most completely lovable of the great masters.
It is hard, moreover, to think of a composer more
strategically placed in his epoch or more perfectly timed
in his coming. Tone poet, fantast, critic, visionary, prophet&mdash;he
was all of these! And he passed through every
phase, it seemed, of romantic experience. The great and
even the semi-great of a fabulous period of music were
his intimates&mdash;personages like Mendelssohn, Chopin,
Liszt, Moscheles, Ferdinand David, Hiller, Joachim,
Brahms. He won the woman he loved after a bitter struggle
against a tyrannical father-in-law. He created much
of the world&rsquo;s greatest piano music, many of its loveliest
songs, four great symphonies, superb chamber compositions
and a good deal else which, even today, is insufficiently
known or valued. A poetic critic, if ever there
was one, he proclaimed to a world, still indifferent or
uncertain, the greatness of a Chopin and a Brahms. His
physical and mental decline was a tragedy even more
poignant than Beethoven&rsquo;s deafness or the madness of
Hugo Wolf. His life story is, in point of fact, vastly more
complex and many-sided than the following handful of
unpretentious and unoriginal pages suggest. These will
have served their purpose if they induce the reader to
familiarize himself more fully with the colorful and
endlessly romantic pattern of Schumann&rsquo;s vivid life and
grand accomplishment.</p>

<p class="center"><i>By</i>
<br />HERBERT F. PEYSER</p>
<p class="tb">At 9:30 on the evening of June 8, 1810, (the same
being Saint Medard&rsquo;s Day), the book publisher August
Schumann and his wife Johanne Christiane, living in
the Haus am Markt No. 5, Zwickau, Saxony, became
the parents of a boy whom they determined to call
Medardus, in honor of the saint of the occasion. Reasonably
well to do if not precisely affluent they were pleased
at the idea of another addition to their little brood of
three boys and a girl&mdash;Eduard, Karl, Julius and Emilie,
respectively. Over night they seem to have thought better
of saddling the newcomer with such a name as Medardus
and six days later the infant was carried to the local
Church of Saint Mary&rsquo;s there to be christened Robert
Alexander. In proper season the &ldquo;Alexander&rdquo; seems for
all practical purposes to have vanished.</p>
<p>August Schumann had not always dwelt on easy street.
Born in 1773 in the village of Entsch&uuml;tz, near Gera, he
was the son of an impecunious country pastor who, despite
his poverty, became a cleric of some eminence.
Unwilling to see the youngster grow up as an object of
charity the preacher gave him four years of high school
education, then apprenticed him to a merchant. But the
lad was not cut out for business; books were his world
and in them he sought refuge from the misery of shopkeeping.
Moreover, he soon developed literary aspirations
of his own and, even though a well-meaning book-seller
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
tried to discourage him, wrote a novel entitled &ldquo;Scenes
of Knighthood and Monkish Legends&rdquo;. The unremitting
labor of study, writing and business chores told on
his health and for the rest of his life he was never wholly
a well man. Yet nothing could diminish his energies or
dampen his ambitions to achieve the glories of authorship.
When he eventually fell in love with a daughter of one
Schnabel, official surgeon of the town of Zeitz, and met
with a downright refusal from that hard-shelled individual
to give his daughter to anyone but a merchant of
independent means, August Schumann was equal to the
challenge. For a year and a half he wrote day and night,
saved up about $750 (a respectable sum at the time)
opened a shop in partnership with a friend in the town
of Ronneberg, married Schnabel&rsquo;s daughter and was
happy. A circulating library formed an adjunct to the
store and the new Mrs. Schumann divided her time
between handling books and selling goods. Her husband
for his part combined the satisfactions of an extremely
prolific authorship with the management of a bookshop,
not to mention the direction of a prosperous business.
In 1808 he moved to Zwickau where he founded the
publishing house of Schumann Brothers, which lasted
till 1840. The firm brought out among other things translations
of the works of Sir Walter Scott and Lord Byron.
One of its showpieces was a so-called &ldquo;Picture Gallery
of the Most Famous Men of all Nations and Ages&rdquo;. At
14 Robert busily puttered around the place, reading
proofs and performing many of the other odd jobs common
to printing establishments.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>For all his zeal and strength of character August
Schumann paid the price of his unsparing toil in the
shape of a nervous malady complicated by other ailments
and attended by accesses of profound melancholy. He
died on Aug. 10, 1826. His children without exception
inherited the diseased strain. Curiously enough, about
the only quality Robert could not regard as an outright
heritage was his musical talent. His father had none of
it and his mother only the most superficial trace. She
was an excellent housewife and a tender soul but of
wholly provincial mentality (which explains, perhaps,
why her restlessly active husband chose her as his mate).
Robert looked like his mother and loved her devotedly.
But his features were about the sole birthright he owed
her. From his father, on the other hand, he acquired
virtually all of those qualities which were to fertilize
his greatest inspirations&mdash;ambition, high principle, productive
activity, imagination, poetic fantasy, whimsicality,
the gift of literary expression and even to a certain
degree that shrewd practical sense which marked some
of his business dealings. Yet to none of his immediate
forbears does he seem to have been indebted for his musical
instincts as such.</p>
<p>Robert&rsquo;s early upbringing was chiefly the business of
his mother. His father, swamped by literary and mercantile
pursuits, had no time for nursery duties. Possibly
the child would have been less spoiled if a paternal hand
had more actively guided him. As it was, Robert became
not only his mother&rsquo;s darling but the pet of every woman
of her large acquaintance. He had his way in everything
and in later years this error of his early training was
reflected in the irritation he sometimes showed when
crossed in his wishes. All the same, this female adulation
did not soften the lad who, at the age of six, was sent
to the private school run by an Archdeacon D&ouml;hner. In
the games and sports of his comrades he was as wild
and turbulent as the roughest of them. Nevertheless, he
did not neglect his school work and exhibited a lively
intelligence. Music fascinated him early. A pupil from a
Latin school, one August Vollert, who obtained free
board at the Schumann home in exchange for a bit of
teaching, gave Robert a little elementary instruction
in the art, though hardly systematic guidance. The
spark was kindled, however. At seven the boy composed
a few little dances. We need not say &ldquo;wrote&rdquo;, for these
trifles were chiefly improvised on the piano. One aspect
of his gift manifested itself early&mdash;a knack for &ldquo;characterizing&rdquo;
people in tone with a kind of delineative
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
justness that both moved and amused listeners. The
child was obviously father to the man who composed the
&ldquo;Carnival&rdquo;!</p>
<p>In Zwickau at the time there was no better musician
than Johann Gottfried Kuntzsch, who long before Robert
was born, had gained a certain distinction by conducting
a performance of Haydn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Creation&rdquo;. August Schumann,
who secretly hoped that his youngest boy might
become such a poet as he himself had always aspired
to be, resolved to cultivate that musical talent which
was beginning to flower. It was to the care of Kuntzsch,
therefore, that he confided him. We know little of the
kind of teaching Robert enjoyed at this stage. Frederick
Niecks surmises that it may have consisted &ldquo;in little more
than telling the pupil what to practise and the first
elementary rules of fingering ... in short, prescription
without exemplification, happy-go-lucky chance without
purposeful system&rdquo;. Niecks adds that Kuntzsch&rsquo;s pupils
could never be sure of escaping a box on the ear and
that &ldquo;on one occasion Robert&rsquo;s bad timekeeping was
even corrected by a stout blackthorn&rdquo;. Yet Robert preserved
a good opinion of Kuntzsch all his life and as late
as 1832 wrote asking permission to dedicate a composition
to &ldquo;the only one who recognized the predominating
musical talent in me and indicated betimes the path along
which, sooner or later, my good genius was to guide me&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In 1820 Robert entered the Zwickau Lyceum (&ldquo;Gymnasium&rdquo;)
to emerge, eight years later, with a certificate
inscribed with a flattering <i>eximie dignus</i>. He was a personable
youngster, blond, bright-eyed, sensitive, temperamental,
prankish. The two subjects particularly dear
to his heart were music and literature. His teachers
thought kindly of his talent for languages. An uncommonly
developed instinct for rhythm and meter expressed
itself in effusions of poetry. At home he spent much
time concocting &ldquo;robber comedies&rdquo; and producing them
with the assistance of his schoolmates. Meanwhile, he
was carrying on his musical studies with the son of a
local bandmaster. The two became fast friends, played
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
overtures and symphonies in four hand arrangements
and even tackled compositions by Hummel and Czerny.
Kuntzsch was anything but pleased by his pupil&rsquo;s displays
of independence. Not having been consulted about
the latter&rsquo;s music-making he suddenly declared that
Robert could now shift for himself. Yet when Kuntzsch
produced an oratorio by F. Schneider at Saint Mary&rsquo;s
Church, young Schumann played the piano accompaniments
while his father, though unmusical, beamed approvingly.
Indeed, August Schumann did everything to
further his son&rsquo;s musical inclinations. The paternal publishing
firm obtained gratis quantities of music from
which Robert was free to take his pick and choice. Father
Schumann provided plenty of music stands for household
concerts and bought a Streicher piano. With some
of his musical comrades Robert produced at home a
setting of the 150th Psalm he had composed. A little
earlier he had heard a concert by the celebrated Ignaz
Moscheles on a trip to Karlsbad in his father&rsquo;s company.
For a long time he was fired with the ambition to study
with this virtuoso. Nothing came of it but the youth
preserved the program of that recital like a sacred relic.</p>
<p>Zwickau duly woke up to the accomplishments of
the wonderchild in its midst. The more prominent citizens
invited him to play at their homes. At the evening
musicales of the &ldquo;Gymnasium&rdquo; he performed things
like Moscheles&rsquo; Variations on the Alexander March and
showpieces by Herz, much in vogue at the time. August,
who had no use for half-baked artists, thought of
placing his boy under Karl Maria von Weber. But just
about this time Weber embarked on the journey to
London from which he was never to return alive. One
person who was more pleased than grieved by the mischance
was Mother Schumann, who harbored an insurmountable
dread of the &ldquo;breadless profession&rdquo; for her
idolized boy. Never did she tire of describing its miseries,
the better to scare him off. Why not adopt a lucrative
profession? The law, for instance. And so, for the time
being, Robert remained in Zwickau, obtaining, as he used
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
to say later, &ldquo;an ordinary high school training, studying
music on the side and out of the fulness of his devotion&rdquo;&mdash;but
alone! In the broadest sense he was to grow up
like his father&mdash;self-taught.</p>
<p>Adolescence subdued the wildness which had so often
characterized the schoolboy. More and more Robert
became a dreamer. He grew selective, too, in his choice
of friends, of whom he had relatively few. One who
stood closest to him was his sister-in-law, Therese, the
wife of his brother Eduard. August Schumann, who had
always hoped that this youngest son might inherit his
own literary and poetic tastes, lived long enough to see
the boy&rsquo;s talents developing along these lines. Robert
kept diaries, note books, memoranda for verses and similar
jottings. He was scrupulously honest with himself;
in one scrapbook, for instance, he made this entry after
some rhymed lines: &ldquo;It was my dear mother who composed
this lovely and simple poem&rdquo;. In another case he
wrote: &ldquo;By my father&rdquo;, and elsewhere: &ldquo;Not by me&rdquo;.
Once he made a timid effort to break into print and
sent some of his effusions to Theodor Hell (otherwise
Karl Winkler), of the Dresden <i>Abendzeitung</i>. He got
them back.</p>
<p>A 17 he became acquainted with the writings of Jean
Paul Richter, then at the peak of his romantic fame.
Perhaps none of Robert&rsquo;s youthful encounters influenced
him so profoundly. Jean Paul colored in one fashion or
another everything he was to write or compose for
years to come. They were kindred souls&mdash;both the poet
of lyric sentimentalisms, fantastic humors, moonlight
raptures, dawns, twilights, tender ecstasies and other
stage settings and properties of romanticism, and his
ardent and sensitive young worshipper. But if more
than any other Jean Paul fired Robert&rsquo;s literary impulses
it was Franz Schubert who lent wings to his musical
fancy. His experience of Schubert began at the home of
Dr. Ernst August Carus and his wife, Agnes, exceptionally
cultured musical amateurs. Schubert was one of
their particular enthusiasms and Robert, whom the couple
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
quickly took to their hearts (they nicknamed him
&ldquo;Fridolin&rdquo;, after a gentle page boy in one of Schiller&rsquo;s
ballads), played four hand compositions with Mrs. Carus,
heard her sing Schubert songs and became familiar with
a good deal of other music, including that of Spohr.
Robert would not have been himself had he not come
to look upon the worthy lady with a kind of exalted
devotion. Soon we find him expressing the state of his
feelings in his best (or worst!) Jean Paul manner: &ldquo;I
feel now for the first time the pure, the highest love,
which does not for ever sip from the intoxicating cup
of sensual pleasures, but finds its happiness only in tender
contemplation and in reverence.... Were I a smile,
I would hover round her eyes; were I joy, I would skip
softly through her pulses; were I a tear I would weep
with her; and if she then smiled again, I would gladly
die on her eyelash and gladly&mdash;yes, gladly&mdash;be no
more&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Shortly after his father&rsquo;s death he had suffered two
cases of calf love&mdash;one for a person called Liddy, the
other for a certain Nanni. First he found them &ldquo;glorious
maidens&rdquo;, whom he longed to adore like the madonnas
he felt sure they were. In the next moment they became
&ldquo;narrow-hearted souls&rdquo;, ignorant of the Utopia in which
he lived.</p>
<p>This Utopia, by the way, was bathed in champagne.
All his life champagne was his favorite beverage, even
as it was of his great contemporary, Richard Wagner,
though like Wagner he would modulate now and then
to beer or a glass of wine. Both masters craved their
champagne whether they had the price of it or not.
And Robert in his student days only too often &ldquo;had not&rdquo;.
His biographer, Niecks, notes disapprovingly that Schumann&rsquo;s
&ldquo;worst failing&rdquo; was: &ldquo;He had no sense of the
value of money and found it impossible to square his
allowance with his expenditures&rdquo;. When his funds ran
out he had a remedy for replenishing them. Again like
Wagner, he seems to have been a virtuoso in the art of
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
writing begging letters that generally brought results.
If his mother, his brothers, his sisters-in-law, his crusty
old guardian, Rudel, ever hesitated a threat of the pawn-shop
or the money-lender was always efficacious. No
wonder Christiane Schumann was frightened by the idea
that her Robert might, for all her efforts, land in the
&ldquo;breadless profession&rdquo;. Successful barristers might easily
indulge their champagne tastes but certainly not musicians
lacking even &ldquo;beer pocketbooks&rdquo;!</p>
<p>In Schneeberg, a town near Zwickau, Robert played
publicly and with immense success a concerto movement
by Kalkbrenner. Alone among his enthusiastic listeners
his mother remained cool. Soon her wishes prevailed
and, though both she and Rudel were aware of the
youth&rsquo;s &ldquo;eternal soul struggle&rdquo; between music and the
law, Robert made a promise of a sort to embrace jurisprudence.
And so, at Easter, 1828, we find him enrolled
at the University of Leipzig as a &ldquo;studiosus juris&rdquo;.
Scarcely arrived in Leipzig he struck up a warm friendship
with another law student, Gisbert Rosen, who shared
Robert&rsquo;s poetic enthusiasms, particularly his devotion
to Jean Paul. Rosen was on the point of removing to
Heidelberg to continue his legal studies and Schumann
quickly formed a plan to accompany his friend on his
journey, with a few stopovers on the way. After a short
visit to Zwickau the two made a pilgrimage to Bayreuth,
where Jean Paul&rsquo;s widow still lived and where the young
men visited every spot which had been sanctified by the
presence of their idol. They continued to Munich
by way of N&uuml;rnberg and Augsburg, where Robert obtained
from a friend of his father a letter of introduction
to Heinrich Heine, then in Munich. He had a lively
conversation with the poet. Possibly if the latter had
been able to foresee that the youth before him would
become, some years later, one of the greatest musical
interpreters of his lyrics he might have treated him with
more warmth than he did.</p>
<p>The law was quite as chilling and distasteful as
he had foreseen. In a few weeks he wrote to his
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
mother telling, among other things, that &ldquo;cold jurisprudence,
which crushes one with its icy-cold definitions
at the very beginning, cannot please me. Medicine I will
not and theology I cannot study.... Yet there is no
other way. I must tackle jurisprudence, however cold,
however dry it may be.... All will go well and I won&rsquo;t
look with anxious eyes into the future which can still
be so happy if I do not falter&rdquo;. Actually, Robert&rsquo;s mind
was made up from the start. He would continue with
the law only as long as he had to. Before renouncing it
altogether he would try the University of Heidelberg,
where his friend Rosen was studying and the sympathetic
and extremely musical jurist, Anton Friedrich Justus
Thibaut, was lecturing.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>The unromantic and featureless environment of Leipzig
at first repelled the youth, who keenly missed the
amiable surroundings of his native Zwickau. Neither
was he happy among the rowdy, swashbuckling students,
ever penniless, ever drunk, ever ridiculous in their notions
of &ldquo;patriotism&rdquo;. For a while Robert was a member
of some of the &ldquo;Burschenschaften&rdquo;, the student clubs,
though he shunned his rough associates as much as he
could. In one respect, however, he resembled them&mdash;he
was continually poor and everlastingly driven to borrowing.</p>
<p>Unquestionably the circle of acquaintances Robert
made during his first days in Leipzig was not large, though
he was very happy to find his old friends from Zwickau,
Dr. and Mrs. Carus. At their home he met some musicians
of prominence&mdash;Heinrich Marschner, then conductor
of the Leipzig Stadttheater; Gottlob Wiedebein,
a song composer of some distinction at the time; and
two people who, almost more than any others, were
destined to play crucial roles in his life&mdash;the piano
teacher, Friedrich Wieck, and his nine-year-old daughter,
Clara, whom her father was assiduously grooming for a
great artistic career.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Wieck, in particular, was a rather extraordinary if unsympathetic
person. He had had a difficult and impecunious
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
youth, kept body and soul together by giving music
lessons for a few pennies a week and subsisted largely on
the bounty of friendly families who invited him, now and
then, to a dinner of roast mutton and string beans. He
aspired to become a minister, studied theology but
preached no more than a trial sermon. He was something
of a traveler and had been to Vienna, where he met
Beethoven. The privations and troubles of his youth hardened
his character. His first wife stood his spectacular
tantrums for eight years, then obtained a divorce and
married a Berlin musician named Bargiel. By this second
marriage the mother of Clara Wieck had a son, Woldemar,
who later made a name for himself as a composer.</p>
<p>Though a hard-boiled martinet and, as time went on,
a tyrant of the first order, Wieck was not wholly without
good qualities. His unscrupulous treatment of Schumann
and his own daughter has made him the object of much
historical obloquy, in the main abundantly justified. Yet
he was a good teacher, for all his irascible, disputatious
ways and his devotion to the artistic causes he believed
in could be very genuine. From the first he appreciated
Schumann&rsquo;s creative talent and never concealed the fact,
outrageously as he came to demean himself to the composer
and Clara alike. Clara was, of course, her father&rsquo;s
most famous pupil. Yet he had others, notably his daughter
by his second marriage, Marie, and Hans von B&uuml;low.
The qualities he aimed to cultivate in his pupils were, according
to Clara, &ldquo;the finest taste, the profoundest feeling
and the most delicate hearing&rdquo;. To this end he demanded
that his students listen to great singers as much as possible
and even learn to sing themselves.</p>
<p>Exactly a year after he had come to Leipzig Robert
was off to Heidelberg there, ostensibly, to carry on his
legal studies with Thibaut and another famous jurist,
Mittermeier. Yet what chiefly busied him at Heidelberg
was not jurisprudence but music. Under the teaching
which, in Leipzig, he had begun to enjoy with Wieck he
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
was developing into a first rate virtuoso and stirred all
who heard him, especially by his fantastic skill in improvisation.
Before long he was turning down invitations
to concertize in places like Mannheim and Mainz. He
practised tirelessly, played, composed, read, &ldquo;poetized&rdquo;
and became one of the social lions of the neighborhood
as well. Out of his old guardian, back in Zwickau, he
wheedled money enough to defray the expenses of a
summer jaunt to Italy. Shortly after his return he heard
Paganini in Frankfort and reacted to the overwhelming
impression in much the same manner as his contemporary,
Liszt, and in an earlier day, Schubert. It was
out of this revelation of diabolical virtuosity that his
piano transcriptions of certain Paganini violin Caprices&mdash;overshadowed
subsequently by those of Liszt&mdash;were
to grow.</p>
<p>To his mother Robert confided little about his creative
achievements in his Heidelberg days, the better to prepare
her for the more remunerative plan he was forming
of a virtuoso career. Yet in this period he conceived
several works which were to become part of the foundations
of his fame&mdash;things like the &ldquo;Abegg&rdquo; Variations,
the &ldquo;Papillons&rdquo;, the superb, vertiginous Toccata. To be
sure, the &ldquo;Papillons&rdquo; were only begun in Heidelberg and
the Toccata revised several years later. A word, however,
about the &ldquo;Abegg&rdquo; Variations, the composer&rsquo;s Op. 1. The
theme is one of those &ldquo;alphabetical&rdquo; inspirations he was
to utilize even more imaginatively later on. That is
to say it is based on the note succession A, B flat, E, G,
G, and its inversion. Schumann had, indeed, known a
flirtatious Meta Abegg in nearby Mannheim and had
developed a tender feeling for her. Yet when he published
the work he found it wiser to resort to mystification
and so he dedicated it to an imaginary Countess
Pauline von Abegg, who served the purpose just as well.
The &ldquo;Abegg&rdquo; Variations, though unmistakable Schumann,
have rather less than their creator&rsquo;s subsequent
technical ingenuity and seem more like outgrowths of
the virtuoso principles of Hummel and Weber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>But the elaborate dreamings and light-hearted pleasures
of Heidelberg could not go on forever. On July 30,
1830, Robert took the bull by the horns and confided
to his mother that music, not law, was for weal or woe
to be his destiny. Wieck was invited to settle the question.
That awesome pedagogue wrote to the widow
Schumann a long and circumstantial letter, larded with
many an &ldquo;if&rdquo; and &ldquo;but&rdquo;. Having considered the problem
from every angle he urged the good woman to yield to
her son&rsquo;s wish. Robert, so Wieck assured her, could
under his training become one of the foremost pianists
of the time. If the plan misfired he could always return
to his legal studies.</p>
<p>To every intent the youth&rsquo;s course was now clear and,
for all time, he was freed from his nightmare. Back in
Leipzig Robert took up his residence in the Wieck home,
the quicker to pursue his pianistic studies. But in one
thing he was less moderate than his teacher could have
wished; he obstinately declined to make haste slowly.
He would become a great pianist, yet he wanted
a short cut to that goal. The idea of practising dull
finger exercises for hours on end every day revolted him.
Already in Heidelberg he had discussed with his friend,
T&ouml;pken, a project for overcoming the weakness of the
fourth finger. He found an excuse for breaking off his
lessons with Wieck a little while and, with his fourth
finger held up by some home-made contrivance, he
practised furiously in solitude. Precisely what happened
we do not know. The first intimation that something
was amiss emanated from a letter written to his brother,
Eduard, on June 14, 1832. Eduard is instructed to show
this passage to his mother: &ldquo;Eduard will inform you
of the strange misfortune that has befallen me. This is
the reason of a journey to Dresden which I am going to
take with Wieck. Although I undertake it on the advice
of my doctor and also for distraction I must do a good
deal of work as well there&rdquo;. Soon afterwards he wrote that
his room &ldquo;looked like an apothecary&rsquo;s shop&rdquo;. For years
to come letters to one person or another speak of treatments
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
and cures, prospects of improvement or stubborn
developments which promise to futilize all his virtuoso
ambitions. The long and the short of it was that Robert
had so incurably lamed his right hand that for purposes
of a public career it was as good as useless. After a
fashion he could still play piano; but the particular glory
to which he aspired was nipped in the bud.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Who shall say that the accident was an unmitigated
misfortune? Would Schumann have bequeathed us the
treasures he did had he wandered incessantly over the
map of Europe to gain the transient rewards of an
itinerant pianist? Would his characteristic style of piano
writing have been what it is? It has been surmised that
certain distinctive traits of it are, directly or indirectly,
the products of his self-made physical disability. And can
we be sure that the nervous instability associated with
the inherited illness of the entire Schumann line might
not have struck him down even earlier, precipitated by
the worries and strains to which an executant is forever
subject? If Robert still wished to be a musician it had
to be in a creative sense.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances he would require a fuller
training than he had yet enjoyed in the technic of composition.
Wieck had recommended for a master in theory
none other than Cantor Weinlig, the teacher of his own
daughter, Clara, and of a certain irresponsible young
firebrand named Richard Wagner. Robert did not accept
the suggestion. Instead he became a pupil of Heinrich
Dorn, recently come to Leipzig, who promised to be a
more progressive person. Schumann esteemed Dorn personally
and long remained his friend. But soon he was
writing to Wieck and his daughter, then off on a concert
tour: &ldquo;I shall never be able to amalgamate with Dorn;
he wishes to get me to believe that music is fugue&mdash;heavens!
how different men are....&rdquo; Nevertheless he
slaved away at his exercises in double counterpoint and
when the study became too intolerably dry he moistened
it with draughts of champagne! His best lessons in counterpoint
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
he obtained from Bach, who was to remain his
supreme divinity all his life. The fugues of the Well
Tempered Clavier he analyzed &ldquo;down to the smallest
detail.&rdquo; When in his melancholy late days he received
a visit from the young Czech, Bedrich Smetana, with a
plea to advise him about musical studies, the taciturn
master said no more than: &ldquo;Study Bach&rdquo;. &ldquo;But I have
studied Bach&rdquo;, protested Smetana. &ldquo;Study him again&rdquo;,
replied the declining composer and relapsed into moody
silence.</p>
<p>It was at Dorn&rsquo;s home, incidentally, that Schumann
made his first acquaintance with Wagner, to whom he
played the &ldquo;Abegg&rdquo; Variations. Wagner did not care
for them on account of their &ldquo;excess of figuration&rdquo;.
Nevertheless, they soon found a publisher. When the
firm of Probst brought out the work the composer was in
the highest measure elated, promised each of his Heidelberg
acquaintances a free copy and wrote that &ldquo;his first
marriage with the wide world&rdquo; made him feel as proud
as the Doge of Venice at his ceremonial wedding with
the Adriatic! The critics were, on the whole, encouraging,
though the notorious Rellstab in his review &ldquo;Iris&rdquo; deplored
the lack in it of any canon or fugue and made
fun of &ldquo;a name one can compose&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>With the children in the Wieck home Robert was a
great favorite. What the youngsters especially enjoyed
were the charades he was in the habit of devising for
their pleasure, the frightening ghost stories he improvised
for them day after day and his shivery enactment
of the various spooks. Riddles, fairy tales&mdash;there was
seemingly no end of the parlor tricks he knew how to
provide on the spur of the moment for the tots. This
deep understanding of children and their psychology
was bound, sooner or later, to find artistic expression
and lovely embodiment in music like the &ldquo;Kinderscenen&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Album for the Young&rdquo;, the one with its
&ldquo;Tr&auml;umerei&rdquo;, the other with its &ldquo;Happy Farmer&rdquo;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>

<p class="caption">The first sketch for The Happy Farmer, from the &ldquo;Album for the Young,&rdquo; Op. 68.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>His grown-up friends he endeavored to choose only
among people who genuinely interested him and who
shared his tastes. Persons who could not partake his high-flown
enthusiasm for Jean Paul or for Bach amounted
almost to mortal enemies! As for Clara, his early feelings
toward the talented daughter of Wieck were scarcely
more than a brother-and-sister affection, even though
some of his more extravagant biographers have written
nonsense about him worshipping her &ldquo;like a pilgrim
from afar some holy altar-piece&rdquo;. In his diaries one can
find such entries as: &ldquo;Clara was silly and scared&rdquo;, &ldquo;With
Clara arm in arm&rdquo;, &ldquo;Clara was stubborn and wild&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Clara plays gloriously&rdquo;, &ldquo;She plays like a cavalry
rider&rdquo;, &ldquo;The &lsquo;Papillons&rsquo; she plays uncertainly and without
understanding&rdquo;! And so it goes in continual contradiction.
We must bear in mind, however, that Clara was
then only about 12 and, however artistically precocious,
hardly more than a child. Her father had seen to it that
she studied violin and singing and had stiff courses in
theory and composition. But it was only after she had
been in Paris in Wieck&rsquo;s company and known Chopin,
Mendelssohn, Kalkbrenner, Herz and other great personages
of the day that she matured into a young woman
who, as Robert said, &ldquo;could give orders like a Leonore&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For his part Schumann was composing industriously.
It is necessary to bear in mind that his early work, which
comprises some of his greatest, is almost exclusively for
the piano. Songs form his second creative stage, then
chamber, then orchestral music. To be sure, choral
works, an opera and miscellaneous creations sometimes
cut athwart the other categories. But his works can be
easily arranged in their respective classifications. The
&ldquo;Papillons&rdquo; is probably the first masterpiece which
achieved what might be called universality. Doubtless
Schumann would have been grieved that anyone should
think of the fantastic little dance movements and mood
pictures which constitute the set without appreciating
their relationship to Jean Paul and his &ldquo;Flegeljahre&rdquo;.
But the whirligig of time has quite reversed the position
of Schumann&rsquo;s enamoring miniatures and the faded romantic
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
work which inspired them. Today we remember
the &ldquo;Flegeljahre&rdquo; chiefly because the &ldquo;Papillons&rdquo;, after
a fashion, recalls it to our attention. But it would be erroneous
to imagine that Jean Paul exclusively, accounts
for those captivating musical fancies that we meet in this
Op. 2&mdash;the clock which strikes six at the close, indicating
that the imaginary throng of revelers is dispersing;
the chord which dissolves, bit by bit, till only a single
note remains; the &ldquo;Grandfathers&rsquo; March&rdquo;, typifying the
old fogies and Philistines generally (an ancient tune of
folk character, which Bach had introduced into his
&ldquo;Peasant Cantata&rdquo; many years earlier). Not without reason
could Schumann claim &ldquo;that Bach and Jean Paul
exercised the greatest influence on me in my early days&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Let us at this point enumerate a few of the men and
women who were gradually coming into Schumann&rsquo;s
orbit, who became, more or less, fixtures in his circle,
or else grazed its circumference and went their different
ways. Among one of the first names we encounter are those
of Henriette Voigt, a lady whom Robert was presently
to call &ldquo;his A flat soul&rdquo;, and Ernestine von Fricken, from
the town of Asch, just across the Czech border. Ernestine
was a lively and coquettish young person, an adopted
illegitimate child, who fascinated Robert, to whom
she briefly became engaged, and who passed out of his
life as breezily as she had come into it. But if Ernestine
was hardly more than a butterfly Robert nevertheless immortalized
her. She is the Estrella of the &ldquo;Carnival&rdquo; for
one thing; and, for another, it was on her account that he
utilized in a diversity of ways the musical motto embodied
in the letters of her home town, Asch. These &ldquo;Sphinxes&rdquo;
as the composer called the series of long-held notes (A
flat, C, B natural, E flat, C, B, and A, E flat, C and B) are
combinations which constitute the basis of numerous
pieces in the &ldquo;Carnival&rdquo;. They are not only letters which
form the name of &ldquo;Asch&rdquo; but are also common to that of
&ldquo;Schumann&rdquo;. Robert was plainly indulging in some more
of his little romantic whimsies, mystifications or epigrams!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Other names we must mention&mdash;irrespective of
chronology&mdash;include Ludwig Schunke, an uncommonly
sympathetic young pianist, who succumbed early to consumption;
Carl Banck, Julius Knorr, A. W. F. Zuccalmaglio,
Felix Mendelssohn, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Francois Chopin,
Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner, Ferdinand
Hiller, Robert Franz. The list might run on indefinitely!</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>These individuals were, for the most part, Davidsb&uuml;ndler.
Let us briefly explain: The &ldquo;League of the
Davidites&rdquo; was an imaginary company, a creation of
Schumann&rsquo;s fancy, composed of many of his friends who
appeared to think as he did and were moved by fresh
musical and poetic impulses. Their sworn duty was to
war on those stodgy traditionalists who harbored principles
which impeded artistic progress. Imaginary
apostles of the biblical David, the giant killer, they
were sworn to smite the Philistines of music, defend and
uphold novel, adventurous and worthy trends, publicize
or advance indubitable merit and, each after his own
fashion, promote the vital and the soundly revolutionary.
Schumann enhanced the play-acting spirit of the movement
by investing various members of the fraternity with
fanciful names. He himself, in true Jean Paul spirit,
gave distinctive labels to the opposing aspects of his own
creative soul. Thus his fiery, soaring, active personality
he called &ldquo;Florestan&rdquo;; the tender, dreamy, passive part
of his nature he identified as &ldquo;Eusebius&rdquo;. When, as sometimes
happened, these two irrepressible Davidites
threatened to get out of hand, there was called in a
moderator to re-establish sanity and balance&mdash;one Master
Raro, whose model in real life seems to have been
Friedrich Wieck. The cast of characters further included
&ldquo;Chiara&rdquo;, &ldquo;Chiarina&rdquo; and &ldquo;Zilia&rdquo;&mdash;otherwise

<p>As a mouthpiece for his idealistic band Schumann
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
founded, in April 1834, the <i>Neue Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Musik</i>&mdash;a
periodical which endured for over a century. Part
of the time he was its acting editor and in any case
certain of its most penetrating and prophetic criticisms
were his own contributions. Possibly the most famous of
these was the jubilant salutation of Chopin&rsquo;s early Variations
on Mozart&rsquo;s &ldquo;La ci darem&rdquo;. This is the article entitled
&ldquo;An Opus 2&rdquo;, which begins with the excited entrance
of &ldquo;Florestan&rdquo; shouting to his fellow Davidites
those words that have become something like a household
expression: &ldquo;Hats off, gentlemen, a genius!&rdquo; The other
is that greeting to the youthful Brahms, a kind of visionary
glorification entitled &ldquo;New Paths&rdquo;, written for the
<i>Neue Zeitschrift</i> almost on the threshold of Schumann&rsquo;s
last illness and including that pathetic cry: &ldquo;How I
should like to be at the side of the young eagle in his
flight over the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A stronghold of conservatism such as Leipzig was not
the most fertile ground for a journal like the <i>Zeitschrift</i>.
More than once Schumann thought very seriously of
transferring it to Vienna, which had had such resplendent
musical associations and promised much. But when
he went there and considered the prospects his heart
sank. What chance had such a paper in a city where the
iron hand of Metternich unmercifully crushed the life
out of every vestige of liberalism and progress? Still,
Schumann&rsquo;s various trips to Vienna were not wholly
unproductive. The city provided the inspiration for one
of his most treasurable piano works, the buoyant &ldquo;Faschingschwank
aus Wien&rdquo;. In the first movement of this
Robert gave his sly humor and spirit of mockery momentary
play by incorporating into the texture of the
exuberant music a phrase from the &ldquo;Marseillaise&rdquo;, which
Metternich&rsquo;s henchmen had sternly forbidden in the
Austrian Empire. Then, too, in Vienna he made the
acquaintance of Schubert&rsquo;s brother, Ferdinand, in whose
home countless musical treasures were gathering dust.
One of those which he was able to rescue from oblivion
was Schubert&rsquo;s great C major Symphony, which he dispatched
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
to Mendelssohn in Leipzig, who in turn conducted
it at a concert of the Gewandhaus.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>But we are anticipating! What should concern us now
is the courtship of Clara by Robert which, though it
ended happily, was actually a long martyrdom for both
and in the best traditions of romantic melodrama. To be
sure it left a deep imprint on Schumann&rsquo;s creative fancy
and for this, if for no other reason, the soul struggle was
a cloud lined with shining silver. Almost all the piano
works of the composer&rsquo;s early period&mdash;in some ways
the most yeasty and influential music he gave the world&mdash;are
in one way or another the fruits of his love.</p>
<p>Clara was nine years younger than her future husband.
Their first relationship was, as he had remarked, a thoroughgoing
brother and sister one. Robert always admired
the pianistic talents of Wieck&rsquo;s daughter though he never
hesitated to criticise defects that came to his attention.
But there was hardly a serious love angle to the familiarity.
It had been different with the shallow but provocative
Ernestine von Fricken, who for some time made her
home at the Wieck residence as a piano pupil, and applied
her coquetries so successfully to Robert&rsquo;s susceptible
heart that before a year was out he had bought
her an engagement ring.</p>
<p>Clara, though she made no complaints, doubtless suspected
with her feminine intuition how matters were
shaping themselves. At one time Schumann&rsquo;s mother had
said to her: &ldquo;Some day you must marry my Robert&rdquo;.
Clara never forgot the remark which seemed to be dictated
by a kind of presentiment. Somewhat later he told
Clara that she was &ldquo;his oldest love&rdquo;; and he added:
&ldquo;Ernestine had to come on the scene the better to unite
us&rdquo;. But at this stage Clara&rsquo;s father gave her little time
for brooding even if she had been disposed to indulge
in any. He worked her hard, took her on concert tours,
culminating in the one to Paris. When she returned home
from one of the longest of these absences, Robert was
the first caller at the Wiecks&rsquo;. What impressed her most
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
was what she considered Robert&rsquo;s coolness; he gave her
&ldquo;hardly so much as a passing greeting&rdquo;, she later complained
to a woman friend. Actually, it was shyness at
his sudden realization that Clara was no longer a child
but a lovely girl which struck him dumb.</p>
<p>Not till she had gone off on another tour was he a
little more explicit. In a letter he wrote her from Zwickau
he said: &ldquo;Through all the joys and heavenly glories
of autumn there gazes out an angel&rsquo;s face, a perfect likeness
of a certain Clara whom I well know&rdquo;; and he
ended with &ldquo;you know how dear you are to me&rdquo;. Even
at that there was no question on either side of outspoken
love. There was much music-making to absorb the pair,
and musical friends were thronging Leipzig. Mendelssohn
arrived and the Davidsb&uuml;ndler jubilated at his coming.
Chopin, whom Clara had already met in Paris, was
steered by Mendelssohn directly to the Wieck home,
where Clara was made to play something of Schumann&rsquo;s&mdash;in
this case the F sharp minor Sonata&mdash;and then
some Chopin Etudes and a concerto movement. Chopin
in his turn performed some of his Nocturnes. The fanciful
Robert wrote: &ldquo;Chopin has been here. Florestan
rushed upon him. I saw them arm in arm, floating rather
than walking&mdash;Eusebius&rdquo;!</p>
<p>Then, one November night, on the eve of another
of Clara&rsquo;s concert trips with her father, Robert called to
say farewell for some weeks. At the foot of the stairs
down which she lighted him he turned and impulsively
took her in his arms. The lightning had struck. &ldquo;When
you gave me the first kiss&rdquo;, Clara wrote later, &ldquo;a faintness
came over me; everything went black before my eyes;
I could scarcely hold the light which was to show you
the way&rdquo;. He went over to Zwickau to hear her. She
kissed him again and during the recital he sat in the
audience thinking: &ldquo;There she sits, dainty and lovable
in her blue dress, loved and applauded by all, and yet
she is mine alone. She knows I am here but must pretend
to be unaware of me. You cannot give me so much as one
look, you, Clara, in your blue dress!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>For a short time they kept their secret, but Wieck was
not long in ferreting out the truth. And now began a
conflict which might easily have wrecked the happiness,
not to say the lives, of any two sensitive young people
less determined and fundamentally hard-headed than
this pair. For Robert things were complicated at the outset
by the death of his mother, following shortly that of
his brother, Julius, and his sister-in-law, Rosalie. The
sadistic hate and the almost psychopathic villainy with
which Wieck now over a space of years persecuted his
daughter and her beloved have been variously explained.
It has been claimed&mdash;perhaps not wholly without reason&mdash;that
he was fully aware of the malady which
lurked in the Schumann family. Instability and morbid
depression had assailed Robert&rsquo;s sensitive spirit as early
as 1833 and he became afflicted with a fear of insanity
which was to grow on him and, in the end, to destroy
him. Moreover, Wieck, though he prized Schumann&rsquo;s
creative gift highly, questioned the solidity of his material
position and the brightness of his prospects. But
not even these considerations could really justify such
elaborate meanness and robustious fury. There was
literally nothing at which he would stop. He threatened
at one stage to shoot Robert if ever he crossed the Wieck
threshold. He forbade all correspondence between the
two lovers. He intrigued against the pair ceaselessly, intercepted
letters, lied, conspired. More than once Schumann
was driven to desperation by Clara&rsquo;s long periods of
apparent silence. Wieck encouraged Carl Banck to visit
his house, then circulated rumors that his daughter had
fallen in love with that friend of Robert&rsquo;s. On one of
her visits to Vienna with her father poor Clara, wishing
to write to Robert but fearing that the removal of an
inkstand for a few minutes might arouse Wieck&rsquo;s suspicions,
found it necessary to tiptoe endlessly from one
room to another in order to dip her pen. Her faithful
maid, Nanny, abetted her in all her ruses and when, in
Leipzig, Clara exchanged a few hurried words with
Robert on a dark street corner Nanny stood guard to
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
make sure the coast was clear.</p>
<p>Clara, planning another concert trip to Paris where a
smashing artistic success might bring her independence,
was horrified to learn that her father washed his hands
of the whole scheme and bade her go alone, taking care
of all the complicated arrangements of concertizing as
best she could. It was a harrowing experience, for the
first thing she did was almost to succumb to the wiles of
an impostor in Stuttgart. Then, when she reached Paris
(her French, incidentally, was very imperfect), she
learned to her dismay that all of her more influential
friends and colleagues&mdash;Mendelssohn, Chopin, Liszt,
Paganini among them&mdash;were not there as she had
expected. Having inherited not a little of her father&rsquo;s
obstinacy Clara stuck it out and, without conquering
the French capital, broadened her experience in many
ways, even to the extent of learning to cook, and cementing
new and valuable friendships, such as one with the
singer, Pauline Garcia, which was to endure for a lifetime.</p>
<p>Despite the machinations of Wieck Clara, back in
Germany, found a means of making her feelings known
to Robert. A devoted friend, Ernst Adolf Becker, suggested
that she perform at a Leipzig concert one of
Robert&rsquo;s works. She chose the &ldquo;Symphonic Studies&rdquo; (the
theme of which the composer had obtained from the
Baron von Fricken, the adoptive father of Ernestine).
Wieck approved. Tyrant as he was he still kept a soft
spot in his heart for Schumann&rsquo;s music. The composer
came to the hall, sat inconspicuously at the rear, listened
and&mdash;knew! In a flash he understood that when she
had lately returned him a package of his letters un-opened
she had been acting under duress.</p>
<p>They still had much to bear, but greatly as it revolted
them they realized that the only solution of their difficulties
lay in a legal decision. To law, accordingly, they
went. Bit by bit Wieck&rsquo;s case disintegrated. With the
help of a friendly advocate Robert was able to show
that his means were ample to support a family. Then
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
Wieck played what he believed would be his trump
card. He maintained that Schumann was a drunkard!
Instantly Robert&rsquo;s friends rallied to his support, Mendelssohn
even declaring himself ready to testify in court
that the accusation was outrageously false. On August 12,
1840, the decision was handed down in favor of the
sorely tried couple and their marriage received judicial
sanction.</p>
<p>On Sept. 5, she gave a concert in Weimar, &ldquo;my last
as Clara Wieck&rdquo;. One week later (and a day before
Clara&rsquo;s twenty-first birthday), they were married at
Sch&ouml;nefeld, a tiny suburb of Leipzig. On the previous
evening Robert had brought her a bridal offering richer
than fine gold&mdash;the song cycle, &ldquo;Myrthen&rdquo;, inclosing
such deathless blooms as &ldquo;Die Lotosblume&rdquo;, &ldquo;Der Nussbaum&rdquo;, &ldquo;Du
bist wie eine Blume&rdquo;, &ldquo;Widmung&rdquo;. And
when they returned from church next morning Clara
wrote in her diary: &ldquo;A period of my life is now closed....
Now a new life is beginning, a beautiful life, a life
in him whom I love above all, above myself. But grave
duties rest with me, too...&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>The period through which we have passed witnessed
the birth of many of Schumann&rsquo;s greatest piano compositions&mdash;the
&ldquo;Davidsb&uuml;ndler T&auml;nze&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Carnival&rdquo;,
the F sharp minor Sonata, the &ldquo;Kinderscenen&rdquo;, the
&ldquo;Symphonic Studies&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Kreisleriana&rdquo;, the C major
Fantasie, the &ldquo;Fantasiest&uuml;cke&rdquo;&mdash;things which along
with others scarcely less great, were to become what
might be called daily bread of pianists. His circle
of musical friends was steadily widening. Those he esteemed
most highly, perhaps, were Mendelssohn and
Chopin. Mendelssohn was to both Robert and Clara
nothing less than a god. The strange thing about this
friendship is that, much as the Schumanns worshipped
Mendelssohn&rsquo;s music, Mendelssohn, to the end of his
days, had virtually nothing to say on the subject of
Schumann&rsquo;s. No doubt its novelty, its bold fantasy, its
unprecedented imaginative qualities were in a measure
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
alien to Mendelssohn&rsquo;s ideals of formal logic, clarity,
order. It was not in his artistic nature to enjoy the work
of a composer who, like Schumann, &ldquo;dreamed with the
pedal down&rdquo;. By the same token it was the fluency, technical
ease and polished workmanship in Mendelssohn&rsquo;s
scores which Robert held in such envious admiration.
Yet with all his skill it is certain that Mendelssohn could
never, for one thing, have painted so unapproachable
a portrait in tones of his friend Chopin as Schumann
achieved in one of the most extraordinary pages of the
&ldquo;Carnival&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Liszt was another master with whom Schumann&rsquo;s relations
were, to put it mildly, singular and paradoxical.
For a long time both Robert and Clara were captivated
by Liszt&rsquo;s phenomenal virtuosity and amazing musicianship.
Liszt preached Schumann&rsquo;s greatness both in word
and deed. He played his works inimitably and with an
originality that brought to light beauties which Schumann,
by his own admission, did not even suspect in his
own creations. When Clara first played Liszt the &ldquo;Carnival&rdquo;
he exclaimed that it was one of the greatest pieces
of music he knew, vastly to Clara&rsquo;s delight. Robert
impulsively dedicated to Liszt the C major Fantasy (in
later years Clara removed the dedication) but as time
went on a coolness developed between the two masters,
which led to at least one highly embarrassing scene
when, on a certain occasion, Liszt, possibly in a spirit of
irony, praised the arch-vulgarian, Meyerbeer, at the expense
of the recently deceased Mendelssohn. Schumann
left the room, fiercely slamming the door behind him. The
breach was eventually healed and Liszt championed
Schumann quite as he had done earlier. But the friendship
had been troubled and, as Schumann&rsquo;s mental condition
worsened, the old relation was never quite restored.
Clara, who developed into a good hater in the
years of her widowhood, came to harbor an implacable
enmity for Robert&rsquo;s one time friend.</p>
<p>Yet in the early days of their married life things were
on the whole, ideal. Robert aspired to deepen Clara&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
musical understanding and the pair undertook a systematic
study of Bach&rsquo;s Well Tempered Clavier, he
&ldquo;pointing out the places where the fugue subject reappears&rdquo;
and giving her an insight into technical mysteries
which she had hitherto lacked. He himself was inspired
by his new found happiness to a perfect deluge of songs&mdash;master
lyrics which rank with those of Schubert as
among the greatest treasurers of song literature. The year
1840 was Schumann&rsquo;s &ldquo;song year&rdquo;. Even before they were
married Robert delighted his prospective bride with the
information: &ldquo;Since yesterday morning I have written
nearly 27 pages of music, of which I can tell you no
more than that I laughed and cried for joy of it....
All this music nearly kills me now, it could drown me
completely. Oh, Clara, what bliss to write songs! Too
long have I been a stranger to it&rdquo;. And a little later:
&ldquo;I have again composed so much that it sometimes
seems quite uncanny. Oh, I can&rsquo;t help it, I should like
to sing myself to death like a nightingale. Twelve Eichendorff
songs! But I have already forgotten them and
begun something new&rdquo;! So it runs on, more extravagantly
in letter after letter, as he enriches the world quite
effortlessly with the &ldquo;Lieder und Ges&auml;nge&rdquo;, Op. 27, the
Chamisso songs, Op. 31, the &ldquo;Liederreihe&rdquo;, Op. 35, the
Eichendorff &ldquo;Liederkreis&rdquo;, Op. 39, the wonderfully psychological
&ldquo;Frauenliebe und Leben&rdquo; cycle, the incomparable
&ldquo;Dichterliebe&rdquo;, the Eichendorff and Heine
&ldquo;Romanzen und Balladen&rdquo;, and so on&mdash;a lyric inundation,
seemingly without end. And just because Schumann
had developed in his piano works such an individuality
of style, and such new phases of keyboard technic the
accompaniments he supplied for many of these Lieder
made the songs artistic creations of an entirely unprecedented
order.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Robert and Clara found out before long, no doubt,
that married people sometimes get in one another&rsquo;s way.
For instance, Robert needed hours and sometimes days
and weeks of quiet for his creative work. On such occasions
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
Clara had to put a stop to her practising. The
two realized that they were rather more hampered than
was agreeable and Robert felt keenly how needful it
is for an artist appearing in public to keep up his technical
practice. Nevertheless she did manage somehow
to get in her necessary hours of practice. Her husband
found that &ldquo;as she lives in nothing but good music her
playing is now certainly the wholesomer and also more
delicate and intelligent than it was before. But sometimes
she has not the necessary time to bring mechanical
sureness to the point of infallibility and that is my fault
and cannot be helped.... Well, that is the way of
artist marriages&mdash;one cannot have everything at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Schumanns would have been glad to see Robert
occupied with some regular work outside his compositions
and his writings for the <i>Neue Zeitschrift</i>. Clara
felt that her husband ought to be occupying an important
conductor position. She would like to have seen
him in such a post at the Leipzig Gewandhaus concerts,
which his friend Mendelssohn had raised to such a level
of distinction. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too ambitious for me&rdquo;, gently
chided Robert, who realized that he was not cut out for
a conductor. Yet this ambition was one of Clara&rsquo;s tragic
failings. We have to thank it for Schumann&rsquo;s later misfortunes
when he let himself be stampeded into accepting
a batonist&rsquo;s post at D&uuml;sseldorf which probably
accelerated his final breakdown. &ldquo;I wish no better place
for myself than a pianoforte and you near me&rdquo;, he had
said not long after they were married. But Clara was to
be incorrigible. She was one of those typical ambitious
wives who drive their husbands into careers for which
they know themselves to be totally unfitted. Yet the
greater the inroads made by Robert&rsquo;s deep-seated malady
on his nervous system the more incapable he seemed of
resisting Clara&rsquo;s urging.</p>
<p>What promised to be a solid and permanent position
for Schumann materialized in the spring of 1843 when
Mendelssohn founded the Leipzig Conservatory. Robert
was given charge of the classes in piano playing; and
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
he taught private composition. His colleagues were men
like the theorist Hauptmann, the violinist, Ferdinand
David, Moscheles, Plaidy, Richter, Klengel and others
of distinguished standing. But it does not appear that
Schumann&rsquo;s actual teaching can have amounted to much.
For he was growing more and more uncommunicative
and the fitness as a pedagogue of such a silent teacher
may be doubted. In 1844 his duties at the Conservatory
were interrupted for four months when he accompanied
Clara on a concert tour to Russia and finally ceased in
the autumn when he suffered a severe nervous breakdown
which led to his removal to Dresden. Some months
earlier he had renounced the editorship of the <i>Zeitschrift</i>.
To his friend, Verhulst, he wrote in June, 1844: &ldquo;I have
given up the paper for this year and hardly think I
shall ever resume it. I should like to live entirely for
composition&rdquo;. Shortly afterwards the <i>Zeitschrift</i> passed
into the hands of Liszt&rsquo;s friend, Franz Brendel.</p>
<p>Schumann was now definitely a sick man. Clara wrote
in her diary that she feared he would not survive the
journey to the Harz mountains and to Dresden which
they had planned in the hope of restoring him; &ldquo;Robert
did not sleep a single night, his imagination painted the
most terrible pictures, in the early morning I generally
found him bathed in tears, he gave himself up completely&rdquo;.
The change of scene and society helped him,
however, and they resolved to settle permanently in
Dresden, whither they moved in the last days of 1844.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>A period of fertile productivity lay behind him. If
1840 was Robert&rsquo;s &ldquo;song year&rdquo;, 1841 was his &ldquo;symphony
year&rdquo; and 1842 his &ldquo;chamber music year&rdquo;, though this
should not be taken as meaning that his creations at
this time were limited to a few works in these genres
exclusively. First of all came the B flat Symphony&mdash;the
&ldquo;Spring&rdquo; Symphony&mdash;which Schumann wrote down
with a steel pen he had found in Vienna in the W&auml;hringer
Cemetery, on Beethoven&rsquo;s grave. The &ldquo;Spring Symphony&rdquo;,
though it had its detractors, put Schumann on
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
the map, so to speak, more almost than anything else he
had written heretofore. Immediately after the symphony
came two other large-scale works&mdash;the so-called &ldquo;Overture,
Scherzo and Finale&rdquo; (which modern conductors
have singularly neglected) and a Phantasie in A minor,
for orchestra and piano, which was to become the first
movement of the glorious Piano Concerto&mdash;for not
a few musicians the greatest of its kind in existence!</p>
<p>On the heels of this soaring masterpiece Schumann
embarked on another symphony. &ldquo;As yet I have heard
nothing about it&rdquo;, wrote Clara in her diary, &ldquo;but from
Robert&rsquo;s way of going on and the D minor sounding
wildly in the distance, I know that another work is being
created in the depth of his soul&rdquo;. Less than four months
later Robert handed his wife as a birthday gift the score
of the D minor Symphony. It was not to see the light
of publicity for some time, however. Before Schumann
had put the finishing touches on it his thoughts began to
be occupied with the subject of &ldquo;Paradise and the Peri&rdquo;,
from Thomas Moore&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lalla Rookh&rdquo;, and he opined
that &ldquo;perhaps something fine can be made out of it for
music&rdquo;. He was right, though the beautiful oratorio&mdash;one
of the finest yet (in America) least familiar of
Schumann&rsquo;s major works&mdash;was not completed for
nearly two years more. When it finally appeared the
composer described it as &ldquo;an oratorio for cheerful people,
not for the place of prayer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1842 Robert and Clara had been occupied
with the study of the string quartets of Haydn and
Mozart. The following October he wrote to the publisher,
Haertel: &ldquo;During the summer months I worked with
great zeal at three quartets.... We played them several
times at David&rsquo;s and they seemed to please players and
listeners alike, in particular Mendelssohn....&rdquo; They are
the Quartets in A minor, F major and A major, Op. 41.
For one thing, they contain some of the most unusual
effects of syncopated rhythm to be found in the entire
range of Schumann&rsquo;s compositions. On the heels of the
quartets came the most popular sample of Schumann&rsquo;s
chamber music, the E flat Piano Quintet, Op. 44, the
first movement of which is perhaps as fine a thing as its
creator ever achieved. Other chamber works followed&mdash;the
E flat Piano Quartet, Op. 47, the so-called Phantasiest&uuml;cke,
for piano, violin and cello, Op. 88, none of
them, however, rising above the level of the Quintet.</p>

can call a ripe old age. The hereditary Schumann illness
passed on to another generation.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Dresden promised to be a pleasant home for the
Schumanns and their growing family. The town was a
center of art and literature. Painters, sculptors, architects,
writers, musicians assembled there, lured by an
art-loving Court. Among the prominent musical figures
of the town were Ferdinand Hiller, Karl Gottlieb Reissiger
and Richard Wagner. Reissiger was, of course, a
mediocrity of the sorriest kind. Hiller, on the other hand,
was a pupil of Hummel and a friend of Berlioz, Liszt
and Mendelssohn and the Schumanns were thoroughly
at home in his company. Wagner was a horse of another
color! It is everlastingly to be regretted that temperamental
differences kept him and Schumann from amalgamating,
for their liberal artistic slants and their incorruptible
idealism should have made them fellow
fighters in the cause of musical progress. Unfortunately
the pair seemed almost to bristle at each other&rsquo;s approach.
Had Wagner matured in his art as early as Schumann
in his, or could they have known one another in the fine
frenzy of Schumann&rsquo;s early Davidsb&uuml;ndler days the story
might have been of an inspiring artistic relationship.</p>
<p>Wagner had been a contributor to Schumann&rsquo;s <i>Zeitschrift</i>
and had entertained a flattering idea of some of
Robert&rsquo;s earlier music. Rightly enough, he noted in it
&ldquo;much ferment but also much originality&rdquo;. He continued
to like &ldquo;Paradise and the Peri&rdquo; and the Piano Quintet
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
and, afterwards, during his Swiss exile, he went so far
as to entreat Clara to play at one of her Zurich concerts
the &ldquo;Symphonic Studies&rdquo;. But thrown frequently together
in Dresden the two repelled rather than attracted
each other. Wagner, who talked incessantly, complained
that one could get nowhere with a person who refused
to open his mouth; Schumann, that one could not possibly
exchange ideas with a man who never allowed one
the opportunity to say a word. Moreover, Wagner&rsquo;s far-darting
and flamboyant ideas were unintelligible to poor
Schumann and even frightened him. And so the two
seemed everlastingly at cross purposes.</p>
<p>Wagner gave Schumann a score of his &ldquo;Tannh&auml;user&rdquo;
as soon as it appeared in a lithographed form. Writing
to Mendelssohn Robert repudiated the music as weak,
forced, amateurish, deficient in melody and wanting in
form. Not long afterwards he went to hear the work
and took back much of what he had said, declaring that
the impression created by a stage performance was very
different and that, though the score did not radiate the
&ldquo;pure sunlight of genius&rdquo; the opera, nevertheless, exercised
on the hearer &ldquo;a mysterious magic which held one
captive&rdquo;. He had been deeply moved by much of it; and
he praised the technical effects and above all the instrumentation
(a thing for which Schumann himself had
always been reproved). Yet in another missive he declared
that Wagner could not write four consecutive
bars of &ldquo;correct&rdquo; music, that he was, all in all, a &ldquo;bad
musician&rdquo;. From the viewpoint of his own art Robert
was to a certain degree logical in his claims. But his
prophetic vision and artist&rsquo;s conscience refused to let
him reject the work outright. Nor should we judge him
too severely for his conclusions. After &ldquo;Tannh&auml;user&rdquo; he
never heard a note of Wagner&rsquo;s music. However he might
have reacted to &ldquo;Tristan&rdquo; it is hardly possible that
Schumann could have brought himself to dismiss Wagner
as a &ldquo;bad musician&rdquo; if he had been spared to hear
&ldquo;Die Meistersinger&rdquo;!</p>
<p>Schumann was present when Wagner read one evening
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
to an assemblage of acquaintances his &ldquo;Lohengrin&rdquo;
libretto. Like a number of other listeners he could not
grasp just what method Wagner could employ in setting
such a text to music. Furthermore he was upset that
another had beat him to the subject of the swan knight,
which he had half a mind to utilize for an opera himself.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Ill health pursued Schumann more and more implacably
during the six odd years of his Dresden sojourn.
He had moments when things seemed to brighten.
At other times the slightest mental effort produced
sleepless nights, auricular delusions, new and terrifying
symptoms which came to haunt him as others disappeared.
He was morbid, irritable, had visions of &ldquo;dark
demons&rdquo; and was assailed by &ldquo;melancholy bats&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Music sometimes helped and sometimes hindered.
Nevertheless the Dresden period saw the creation of some
of his greatest works&mdash;the completion in 1845, of the
A minor Piano Concerto, by the addition of the Intermezzo
and the Finale to the Phantasie written in 1841;
the magnificent C major Symphony, with its melting
Adagio, its breathless scherzo, its resplendent finale;
the &ldquo;Scenes from Faust&rdquo;, the Overture and incidental
music to Byron&rsquo;s &ldquo;Manfred&rdquo; and the opera, &ldquo;Genoveva&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Limitations of space forbid us to consider in any detail
works like the Piano Concerto, the C major Symphony
and the rugged &ldquo;Manfred&rdquo; Overture&mdash;so different in
its sombre, moody character from the romantic effusions
of Schumann&rsquo;s earlier day. But the opera, &ldquo;Genoveva&rdquo;
though branded a failure contains superb music, beginning
with the overture which, in its different fashion,
ranks with the one to &ldquo;Manfred&rdquo;. The prayer of the fated
Genoveva in the last act is a long <i>scena</i> comparing in its
far-flung lyric line with the noblest vocal pieces Schumann
ever wrote.</p>

<p>Clara cared tenderly for her ailing husband and left
nothing undone to comfort him. She would use all her
culinary skill to make it certain that his meals would be
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
bright spots in his often troubled days. A friend who
met her returning from market in one instance inquired
what she was carrying in a strange-looking packing.
&ldquo;Something to tempt my poor husband&rsquo;s appetite&mdash;mixed
pickles&rdquo;, she answered. They had friends in a
certain Major Serre and his wife who had a country
estate at a place called Maxen, near Dresden, and she
took Robert there from time to time to benefit by the
pleasant country surroundings. But his stay in Maxen
was spoiled by the view from one of the windows of a
lunatic asylum nearby. And as the years passed and his
condition deteriorated the sight of an asylum brought
his melancholy to an almost intolerable stage.</p>
<p>It was to Maxen that Clara brought him and her
children when, during the revolutionary uprising in May,
1849, they found it necessary to flee from Dresden till
order was restored. Pretending to take her husband for
a walk she picked her way at sundown through the
fields and hills surrounding the city and reached the
Serre estate in the small hours of the morning, terrified
by the armed mobs they continually met and the sounds
of shooting in the distance. Then, without waiting to rest
or refresh herself, Clara had to set out for Dresden once
more to bring the children to a place of safety. Back
in Maxen she restrained her feelings with difficulty
when she was met by contemptuous allusions from her
aristocratic hosts to &ldquo;canaille&rdquo; and &ldquo;rabble&rdquo;. &ldquo;How
men have to fight for a little freedom!&rdquo; she confided in
her diary. &ldquo;When will the time come when all men will
have equal justice? How is it possible that the belief
can so long have been rooted among the nobles that
they are of a different species from the bourgeois?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the fall of 1849 Schumann received a letter from
Ferdinand Hiller, on the point of leaving D&uuml;sseldorf,
inquiring whether he would be disposed to succeed him
as Musical Director in that Rhenish town. The salary
was good, the duties heavy but stimulating. Schumann
reflected that Dresden had never shown itself in the least
inclined to give the illustrious artist couple within its
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
gates the faintest official recognition. Hiller&rsquo;s offer seemed
promising. Robert started to look up information about
D&uuml;sseldorf. In an old geography book he found that the
town&rsquo;s attractions included &ldquo;three convents and a lunatic
asylum&rdquo;. Nevertheless, they decided in its favor.</p>
<p>They took a cool farewell from Dresden and arrived
in D&uuml;sseldorf on Sept. 2, 1850. They were greeted with
extreme cordiality, wined and dined, serenaded and
threatened with the exhausting honors of dances, picnics
and excursions. Until they could find a suitable house and
garden they were lodged in the best (and most expensive!)
hotel. The Music Committee turned itself inside
out to make life pleasant for its new conductor and his
illustrious artist-wife. Robert was forty, seemingly in the
prime of life but actually past his best creative period,
and glad that an apparently desirable opportunity was
opening up to him at last.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Tragic deception! Whether or not Schumann realized
it from the first, the D&uuml;sseldorf period was the beginning
of the end. It quickly became obvious that Robert had
no ability whatever as a conductor, none of the dominating
qualities to impose his wishes on orchestras or choral
masses. He could think of no better methods of correcting
a defect of execution than to ask his players or singers
to repeat a passage over and over, without ever making
plain to them what he wanted. The performers became
listless, inattentive or downright rebellious. Things grew
progressively worse and the decline of musical standards
in D&uuml;sseldorf became town talk. The worry and physical
strain involved told sorely in Schumann&rsquo;s afflicted nervous
constitution. He developed an embarrassing habit
of dropping his baton at rehearsals, till he hit on the
scheme of fastening it to his wrist with a piece of
string! &ldquo;There, now it can&rsquo;t fall again!&rdquo;, he sheepishly
told a friend who gazed at his arm in questioning wonder.
His mental ailment bit by bit robbed him of the
alertness, concentration, presence of mind, &ldquo;even the
ability to speak audibly&rdquo;. Clara, unable apparently to
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
recognize the truth, suspected intrigues on every hand.
Her blood &ldquo;boiled&rdquo; over the &ldquo;disrespectful behaviour of
some of the choir&rdquo; at a rehearsal of the &ldquo;St. Matthew
Passion&rdquo; and she developed a particular enmity against
the well-meaning if uninspired conductor, Julius Tausch,
who gradually took over some of Schumann&rsquo;s most taxing
labors.</p>
<p>Robert&rsquo;s taciturnity had been growing on him for
years but it finally took utterly fantastic forms. We are
told that in D&uuml;sseldorf he could not say: &ldquo;Ladies and
gentlemen, our next rehearsal will be tomorrow at seven&rdquo;,
without breaking down once or twice. In another case
a certain Carl Witting was commissioned to visit Schumann
in order to settle a debated point about the tempi
in the &ldquo;Manfred&rdquo; Overture. After putting his question
to the composer who was smoking a cigar (Robert had
been an inveterate smoker from his youth) he received
for all answer only the query: &ldquo;Do you smoke?&rdquo;
Witting said he did and waited respectfully. Schumann
neither offered a cigar nor gave a reply. Two more
inquiries brought only another &ldquo;Do you smoke?&rdquo; The
persistent silence finally impelled Witting to take his
leave, thinking one knows not what. Still another idiosyncrasy
of Robert&rsquo;s later days was to frequent a restaurant,
order a glass of wine or beer and leave without
attempting to pay. The proprietor was not disturbed,
but simply gave Schumann what amounted to a charge
account and sent the bills to Clara.</p>
<p>One of the first excursions Robert and Clara took
after their arrival in D&uuml;sseldorf was to Cologne.
Schumann was charmed by the surrounding countryside
and deeply impressed by an ecclesiastical ceremony he
witnessed in the Cologne Cathedral. The visit provided
the inspiration for the Symphony in E flat, the so-called
&ldquo;Rhenish&rdquo;, published as the third, actually the fourth
in date of composition (if we except the 1851 revision
of the earlier D minor). The resplendent work has a
freshness and a youthful ardor which seem to belie the
composer&rsquo;s encroaching mental impairment. The climax
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
of the symphony is its monumentally conceived fourth
movement in which Schumann strove to picture the
solemnity he had witnessed in that stately fane. The
other movements abound in those shifted accents and
other rhythmic surprises which were always a hallmark
of the composer&rsquo;s style.</p>
<p>One marvels at the quantity if not always at the
quality of Schumann&rsquo;s D&uuml;sseldorf compositions. These
include overtures to Shakespeare&rsquo;s &ldquo;Julius Caesar&rdquo;,
Goethe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hermann und Dorothea&rdquo; and Schiller&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Braut von Messina&rdquo;; the &ldquo;Pilgrimage of the Rose&rdquo;,
the &ldquo;Peri&rdquo;; a fine Cello Concerto in A minor, and a violin
concerto in D minor, written for Joseph Joachim, but
secreted for years in the Berlin State Library and, though
once tried out by Joachim, never played or published
till recent years on the plea that it might by its weakness
diminish Schumann&rsquo;s reputation. As a matter of fact the
concerto, which is typical late Schumann, seems to have
been much too severely judged by Joachim and even
Clara herself.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>The impossible situation in D&uuml;sseldorf could not continue.
At first the Schumanns resolved to leave and
settle down in Vienna. But that scheme proved impractical.
The sorry conductorship came to its inevitable end.
The Schumanns, much relieved, set out on a tour of
Holland which had triumphal results for Clara. Back in
D&uuml;sseldorf, though no longer in an official capacity,
Robert on Sept. 30, 1853, was handed a card inscribed
&ldquo;Herr Brahms from Hamburg&rdquo;. Next day he scribbled
in a diary: &ldquo;Visit from Brahms (a genius)&rdquo;. And there
began one of the most touching friendships in musical
history, one that long survived the mortal Schumann
and continued for the duration of Clara&rsquo;s years on earth.</p>
<p>To Joseph Joachim, who had armed the twenty year
old North German with the introduction he presented,
Robert instantly wrote &ldquo;in prophetic style&rdquo; the words:
&ldquo;This is he who should come&rdquo;. And only a few days
later, another concerning &ldquo;Johannes the true Apostle&mdash;the
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
young eagle that has flown so suddenly and unexpectedly
from the hills to D&uuml;sseldorf....&rdquo; Then snatching
his long unused editorial pen he began that famous
essay, &ldquo;New Paths&rdquo;, published on Oct. 28,
1853, in the <i>Neue Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Musik</i>, and which
definitely started Brahms on the path of glory leading
to deathlessness.</p>
<p>Brahms, Joachim, Albert Dietrich, J. O. Grimm&mdash;these
perhaps more than any others were the men whose
friendship was the chief solace of Schumann in his now
rapid decline. He still took his walks with Clara and
the children. With his lips pursed as if whistling and his
hands clasped behind him he was a familiar figure as
he wandered in a kind of abstraction through the parks
of D&uuml;sseldorf. New and alarming symptoms steadily
manifested themselves. In 1854 he had &ldquo;marked and
painful auditory sensations&rdquo;, including a maddening
affliction that took the shape of hearing melodies in two
conflicting keys at once. His speech was heavier and his
demeanor grew more and more apathetic. With increasing
hallucinations he developed a morbid enthusiasm
for spiritism and table rappings. He had dreams
in which the spirits of Schubert and Mendelssohn dictated
musical themes to him; or else he heard angelic
voices which presently changed to the howling of demons
threatening him with torments. On Feb. 26, 1854, he rose
in a state of terrible melancholy, begged to be sent
to an asylum and began to pack up the things he wished
to take with him. Clara, wishing to speak to their friend
and physician, Dr. Hasenclever, left the room for a moment.
Suddenly Schumann opened his bedroom door
and&mdash;vanished! A few minutes later he was brought
back, dripping with water. Half clad, he had gone out,
thrown himself into the Rhine but was saved from
drowning by some fishermen who had seen the suicidal
leap. On March 4 he was taken at his own wish to the
private asylum of Dr. Richarz at Endenich, near Bonn.
He left in a carriage accompanied by two doctors. Clara,
from whom he took only a perfunctory leave, stayed behind,
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
crushed. Someone had handed Schumann flowers as
he drove away. He gave a few of them to Dr. Hasenclever,
who afterwards took them to Clara. For a while
his condition seemed to improve. He worked now and
then at his music, composed a few variations on the
theme he claimed to have received from the spirit of
Schubert and wrote a piano accompaniment for some of
the Paganini Capriccios. But by 1855 all hope was
abandoned and in 1856 Clara, on a concert tour in
England, was informed that Robert was &ldquo;irretrievably
lost&rdquo;. Soon a telegram summoned her to Endenich &ldquo;if
she still wanted to see her husband alive&rdquo;. With Brahms,
who for nearly two years had watched over Robert
and the sorely tried Clara with unexampled devotion,
she went to the sanatorium, saw Robert and believed
that, though he seemed to converse with spirits, he recognized
and welcomed her after the long separation.
On July 29, 1856, he was, in Clara&rsquo;s words &ldquo;to be
freed from his troubles; at four in the afternoon he
passed gently away. His last hours were peaceful and
so he passed in sleep, unnoticed&mdash;nobody was with
him at the moment. I saw him half an hour later.
Joachim had come from Heidelberg on receiving our
telegram....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Two days afterwards Schumann was laid to rest in
the lovely Old Cemetery at Bonn. Members of the
D&uuml;sseldorf &ldquo;Concordia&rdquo;, which had serenaded the Schumanns
on their arrival from Dresden six years earlier,
were the pallbearers. Hiller, Joachim and Brahms walked
in front, Clara, alone and unobserved, far behind&mdash;&ldquo;certainly
as he would have wished&rdquo;. Forty years later, on
Whit-Sunday, 1896, she was reunited with him in the
same tomb, in the presence of her surviving children
and a few friends, chief of these the faithful Brahms,
himself barely a year from his end.</p>
